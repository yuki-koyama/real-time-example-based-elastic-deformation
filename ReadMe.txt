Note:
0) This is released for non-commercial use only.
1) This implementation is slightly modified from the version of making the demos and recording the timings for the paper.
2) It is not widely tested.
3) This source code can be built using Xcode (tested on Xcode 4.3.2) only. Other environments are not supported. (But the source code is written in standard C++, so porting might not be so difficult.)
4) If you want to build and use it on other OS, please achieve it by yourself. 


How to build:
This source code can be built using Xcode (tested on Xcode 4.3.2) only.
Real-Time_Example-Based_Elastic_Deformation.xcodeproj is the project file for Xcode.


How to use:
Please see this example of use:

If you want to learn more, please read the source code. (I'm sorry not to write a detailed documentation.)
